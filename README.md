# Hack-that-Trash

An interactive AI game that classifies debris as recyclable, compostable, or trash. As you scan more items, points can be earned depending on the type of debris and move up the local and global leaderboards. 

The classification runs through two machine learning models: one was created using Microsoft Azureâ€™s CustomVision API and the other was created from scratch using Keras, TensorFlow, and Core ML. The game is deployed on iOS platforms and created using Swift and XCode. 

**Awarded First Place Hack and finalist at Microsoft San Francisco Girls in AI hackathon.
